This is a heavy modification/hack of R.J. Hudspith's framework "GLU" to measure
the symmE and symmQ full 4D correlator, without cuts, along the Wilson flow. The
modification also measures the average polyakov loop in all 4 dimensions separately,
real and imaginary parts. 

To compile the code with OpenMP and FFTW support, I personally ran (after an automake,
etc type deal):

./configure --prefix=/home/weinbe2/Documents/GLU/install --with-fftw=/home/weinbe2/bin/fftw/install/ --enable-OMP_FFTW  CC=gcc  CFLAGS="-Wall -O3 -ffast-math -fopenmp"
make
make install

You'll want to replace the path after "--prefix=" with where you want GLU to be
installed after running "make install". You'll also want to replace the path
after "--with-fftw=" with the install directory for a version of FFTW.

The only testing I've done has been with FFTW active and with OpenMP support
turned on. I haven't even checked if the unit testing still works with the
modifications I've done! I should talk to Jamie about this, but one thing
at a time.

I've included a few useful sample files in the directory 'reference_esw'. One
is an up-to-date example configure file, 'wflow_cfg'. (Since the reference files
that otherwise come with GLU won't work anymore, nor will the ones GLU will
generate for you... more to-do's!)

All of the lines in 'wflow_cfg' need to be there, but only a few need to be
modified or need mention. They are:

1) MODE = GAUGEFLOW

This specifies the mode "gauge measurements along wilson flow".

22)  OUTPUT = ./

This specifies what directory to save the 4D correlator outputs to, as well as
possibly a prefix to each output. For example, you could write:

OUTPUT = ./cfg300

And then each output would go to the working directory, with the prefix "cfg300"
on the filename. 

23) SMEARTYPE = WFLOW_STOUT

This specifies using the non-adaptive stout link Wilson flow. Other versions 
built into GLU may work... I just never tried them. So stick with this!

25) SMITERS = 10

How many Wilson flow steps to do in total. 

26) ALPHA1 = 0.01

This specifies the Wilson flow step size to use.

29) GAUGEFLOWTYPE = ALL
30) NMEAS = 3
31) MEASSTEPS = 0,2,4

This is where the magic happens. Line 29 specifies "ALL", which means do the 
symmE, symmQ correlators, as well as the Polyakov loop. You can change it to
just measure one of those... but why bother?

Line 30 specifies how many Wilson flow steps to do the measurements on. The 
number here should agree with the number of comma-separated steps on the next
line.

Line 31 specifies a comma-delimited list of Wilson flow steps to perform 
measurements at. The current set up, "0,2,4", means to do the symmE, symmQ,
and Polyakov loop measurements on the original gauge fields, after doing
two steps of Wilson flow, and after doing four steps of Wilson flow.

I think we should look into doing measurements at fixed percentages of the
number of steps required for symmE to hit the Wilson flow scale \sqrt{8t_0},
but that's just me. 

36) STORAGE = SCIDAC

Change this if necessary, shouldn't be though!

------

That's all. To do a series of configurations, I'd make a separate copy of the
"wflow_cfg" file with the appropriate changes (likely to "OUTPUT") for each
configuration. Each ensemble on its own will need other properties changed, of
course. 

To call GLU, I included a reference command in the file "reference_command":

./GLU -c wflow_cfg -i weakfld_8x16w0.01 -o weakfld_8x16w0.01_flow

In this case, the filename after "-c" should be the configuration file, the
filename after "-i" should be the file name (appropriately ln -s'd to be in
the running directory, I imagine). The filename after -o doesn't matter for
the GAUGEFLOW measurements because those measurements don't save the gauge
field.
